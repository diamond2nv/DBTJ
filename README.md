# DBTJViewer
A Python3 GUI for visualising Double Barrier Tunneling Junction behaviour of Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STS) data from a Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM).

The model follows that proposed by Hanna and Tinkham (Hanna and Tinkham, Phys. Rev. B 44, 5919 (1991)).

Essentially tunneling occurs through a central electrode where two tunneling barriers (tip-central electrode and central electrode-substrate) are each modelled by a resistor and capacitor in parallel.
